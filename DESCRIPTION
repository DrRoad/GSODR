Description: Download and format weather data from USA National Climatic Data
    GSOD weather data stations are individually checked for number of missing
    days to assure data quality, stations with too many missing observations are
    omitted. Output is .csv file summarizing each year, which includes vapor
    pressure and relative humidity variables calculated from GSOD data.
    An individual country of interest may be selected as well as only stations
    falling between -60/60 degrees latitude for agroclimatology work.
    The output .csv file includes station data (e.g., station name, lat, lon,
    elevation, etc.) for use in a GIS.
    The package also calculates ea - mean daily actual vapor pressure; es - mean
    daily saturation vapor pressure; and RH - mean daily relative humidity.
