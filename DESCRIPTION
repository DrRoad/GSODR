Description: The GSODR package offers automated downloading, parsing, cleaning,
    unit conversion and formatting of Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD)
    weather data from the from the USA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).
    All units are converted from from United States Customary System (USCS)
    units to International System of Units (SI). Stations may be individually
    checked for number of missing days defined by the user, where stations
    with too many missing observations are omitted. Only stations with valid
    reported latitude and longitude values are permitted in the final data.
    Additional useful variables, saturation vapour pressure (es), actual vapour
    pressure (ea) and relative humidity are calculated from the original data
    and included in the final data set. A list of elevation values generated from
    a 200 metre buffer of 90m elevation data, CGIAR-CSI SRTM hole-filled 90
    metre data (Jarvis et al. 2008), are included for stations between -60 and
    60 degrees latitude. The resulting data include station data (e.g., station
    name, country, latitude, longitude, elevation) and weather observations and
    associated flags. Data may be automatically saved to disk. File output may
    be returned as a comma-separated values (CSV) or GeoPackage (GPKG) file.
    For information on the original data from NCDC, please see the GSOD
    readme.txt file available from,
