Description: The GSODR package offers automated downloading, parsing, cleaning,
    unit conversion and reformatting of Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD)
    weather data from the from the USA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).
    All units are converted from from United States Customary System (USCS)
    units to International System of Units (SI). Stations are individually
    checked for number of missing days defined by the user, where stations
    with too many missing observations are omitted. Only stations with valid
    reported latitude and longitude values are permitted in the final file.
    Additional useful variables, saturation vapour pressure (es), actual vapour
    pressure (ea) and relative humidity are calculated from the original data
    and included in the final data set. A list of values for 200 metre buffered
    elevation data, derived from the CGIAR-CSI SRTM hole-filled 90 metre data
    set (Jarvis et al. 2008), are included for stations between -60 and 60
    degrees latitude. The resulting file includes station data (e.g., station
    name, country, latitude, longitude, elevation) and weather observations and
    associated flags. File output is returned as a comma-separated values (CSV)
    or GeoPackage (GPKG) file written to a local disk. For information on the
    original data from NCDC, please see the GSOD readme.txt file available from,
    <http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/gsod/readme.txt>.
