Description: Download and format weather data from USA National Climatic Data
    GSOD weather data stations are individually checked for number of missing
    days to assure data quality, stations with too many missing observations are
    omitted. Due to the size of data involved, output is returned as a .csv file
    written to disk in a location selected by the user, which summarizes each
    year by station and includes new variables: actual and saturation vapor
    pressure and relative humidity calculated from the original GSOD data.
    An individual country of interest may be selected as well as only stations
    falling between -60/60 degrees latitude for agroclimatology work.
    The output .csv file includes station data (e.g., station name, lat, lon,
    elevation) for use in a GIS.
