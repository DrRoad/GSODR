Description:  The GSODR package offers automated downloading, parsing, cleaning
    and converting of Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) weather data from
    the from the USA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) into Comma Separated
    Values (CSV) or Geopackage (GPKG) files. The get_GSOD() function retrieves
    data from the NCDC's public FTP site and reformats it from United States
    Customary System (USCS) units to International System of Units (SI).
    Stations are individually checked for number of missing days as defined by
    the user to help ensure data quality. Stations files with too many missing
    observations are omitted from the final file. Only stations with valid
    reported latitude and longitude values are permitted in the final derived
    data set. A list of values for 200 metre buffered elevation data, derived
    from the CGIAR-CSI SRTM hole-filled 90 metre data set (Jarvis et al. 2008)
    are included for stations between -60 and 60 degrees latitude with valid
    latitude and longitude values. File output is returned as a comma-separated
    values (CSV) or GeoPackage (GPKG) file written to a local disk in a location
    selected by the user, which summarises each year by station. Additional
    useful variables, saturation vapor pressure (es), actual vapor pressure (ea)
    and relative humidity are calculated from the original data and included in
    the final data set. The resulting files can be as larger than 500mb
    depending on the user's stringency for missing data and geographic area of
    interest. Be sure to have sufficient RAM and disk space as well as a
    reasonably fast internet connection to use this package to perform this
    operation for a global data set over many years. However, for much smaller
    and more manageable data sets, an individual country of interest may be
    selected as well as only stations falling between -60 and 60 degrees
    latitude for agroclimatology work or individual stations if the station ID
    is known. The resulting files include station data (e.g., station name,
    country, latitude, longitude, elevation) or use in a geographic
    information system (GIS). The function was largely based on T. Hengl's
    'getGSOD.R' script, available from
    <http://spatial-analyst.net/book/system/files/getGSOD.R> with enhancements
    to be cross-platform, more efficient with computing resources and more
    flexible. For information on the original data from NCDC, please see the
    GSOD readme.txt file available from,
    <http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/gsod/readme.txt>.
