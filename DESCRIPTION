Description: Download and format weather data from USA National Climatic Data
    GSOD weather data stations are individually checked for number of missing
    days to assure data quality, stations with too many missing observations are
    omitted. Due to the size of data involved, output is returned as a .csv file
    written to disk in a location selected by the user, which summarizes each
    year by station and includes new variables: actual and saturation vapor
    pressure and relative humidity calculated from the original GSOD data. These
    files can be as large as 500mb depending on your stringency for missing data
    and geographic area of interest. Be sure to have sufficient RAM and disk
    space to use this package to perform this operation. However, for much
    smaller and more manageable data sets, an individual country of interest may
    be selected as well as only stations falling between -60/60 degrees latitude
    for agroclimatology work (this is the default behaviour). The output .csv
    files include station data (e.g., station name, country, latitude,
    longitude, elevation) for use in a GIS.
