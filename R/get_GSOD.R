#' Download, Clean, Reformat and Generate New Variables From GSOD Weather Data
#'
#'This function automates downloading, cleaning, reformatting of data from
#'the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) data provided by the US National
#'Climatic Data Center (NCDC),
#'\url{https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod},
#'and calculates three new variables; Saturation Vapor Pressure (ES) â€“ Actual
#'Vapor Pressure (EA) and relative humidity (RH). Stations are individually
#'checked for number of missing days to assure data quality, stations with too
#'many missing observations are omitted. Additionally, stations reporting a
#'latitude of < -90 or > 90 or longitude of < -180 or > 180 are removed. All
#'units are converted to International System of Units (SI), e.g., Fahrenheit to
#'Celsius and inches to millimetres. Alternative elevation measurements are
#'supplied for missing values or values found to be questionable based on the
#'Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research's Consortium for
#'Spatial Information group's (CGIAR-CSI) Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 90
#'metre (SRTM 90m) digital elevation data based on NASA's original SRTM 90m
#'data. Further information on these data and methods can be found on GSODR's
#'GitHub repository here:

#'
#' @param years Year(s) of weather data to download.
#' @param station Specify a station or multiple stations for which to retrieve,
#' check and clean weather data. The NCDC reports years for which the data are
#' available. This function checks against these years. However, not all cases
#' are properly documented and in some cases files may not exist on the ftp
#' server even though it is indicated that data was recorded for the station for
#' a particular year. If a station is specified that does not have an
#' existing file on the server, this function will silently fail and move on
#' to existing files for download and cleaning from the ftp server.
#' @param country Specify a country of interest for which to retrieve weather
#' data; full name. For stations located in locales
#' having an ISO code 2 or 3 letter ISO code can also be used if known. See
#' \code{\link{country_list}} for a full list of country names and ISO
#' codes available.
#' @param dsn Path to file write to. (Optional)
#' @param filename The filename for resulting file(s) to be written with no
#' file extension. Year and file extension will be automatically appended to
#' file outputs. Defaults to "GSOD-year". (Optional)
#' @param max_missing The maximum number of days allowed to be missing from a
#' station's data before it is excluded from final file output. Defaults to five
#' days. If a single station is specified, this option is ignored and any data
#' available, even an empty file, from NCDC will be returned.
#' @param agroclimatology Logical. Only clean data for stations between
#' latitudes 60 and -60 for agroclimatology work, defaults to FALSE. Set to
#' TRUE to include only stations within the confines of these
#' latitudes.
#' @param CSV Logical. If set to TRUE, create a comma separated value (CSV)
#' file ile and save it locally in a user specified location. Depends on
#' \code{dsn} being specified.
#' @param GPKG Logical. If set to TRUE, create a GeoPackage file and save it
#' locally in a user specified location. Depends on \code{dsn} being specified.
#'
#' @details
#' Data summarize each year by station, which include vapour pressure and
#' relative humidity variables calculated from existing data in GSOD.
#'
#' If the option to save locally is selected. Output may be saved as comma-
#' separated, CSV, files or GeoPackage files in a directory specified by the
#' user, defaulting to the current working directory.
#'
#' When querying selected stations and electing to write files to disk, all
#' years queried and stations queried will be merged into one final ouptut file.
#'
#' All missing values in resulting files are represented as NA regardless of
#' which field they occur in.
