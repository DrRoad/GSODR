# Introduction

The GSODR package provides the ability to interact with GSOD data using
spatial methods. The `get_GSOD` function allows for the data to be saved as
a GeoPackage file which can be read by most GIS software packages or in R using
R's GIS capabilities with contributed packages as well.

Following is an example of how you might download and save GSOD annual data for
a given country, Philippines in this example, and convert it into a KML file for
viewing in GoogleEarth. The second portion uses the same GeoPackage file to
import the data back into R and combine the GSOD data with the included CHELSA
data and plot the station temperatures for daily GSOD, average monthly GSOD and
CHELSA temperatures (1979-2013).

## Example - Download and plot data for a single country
Download data for Philippines for year 2010 and generate a spatial, year summary
file, PHL-2010.gpkg, in the user's home directory.


```r
library(GSODR)
get_GSOD(years = 2010, country = "Philippines", dsn = "~/",
         filename = "PHL-2010", GPKG = TRUE, max_missing = 5)
```

                data = pnts@data[, c("TEMP", "STNID")],
                endTime = pnts$DATE + 0.5)

Compare the GSOD weather data from the Philippines with climatic data provided
by the GSODR package in the `GSOD_clim` data set.

                           CHELSA_TEMP = as.vector(unlist(clim_temp[, cnames])))

pnts$MONTHC <- as.numeric(paste(pnts$MONTH))
temp <- left_join(pnts@data, clim_temp_df, by = c("STNID", "MONTHC"))
```

```

# Notes

## Sources

#### CHELSA climate layers
CHELSA (climatic surfaces at 1 km resolution) is based on a quasi-mechanistical
statistical downscaling of the ERA interim global circulation model
(Karger et al. 2016). ESA's CCI-LC cloud probability monthly averages are based
on the MODIS snow products (MOD10A2). <http://chelsa-climate.org/>

#### EarthEnv MODIS cloud fraction 
<http://www.earthenv.org/cloud>

#### ESA's CCI-LC cloud probability
<http://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/index.php>

#### Elevation Values

90m hole-filled SRTM digital elevation (Jarvis *et al.* 2008) was used
to identify and correct/remove elevation errors in data for station
locations between -60˚ and 60˚ latitude. This applies to cases here
where elevation was missing in the reported values as well. In case the
station reported an elevation and the DEM does not, the station reported
is taken. For stations beyond -60˚ and 60˚ latitude, the values are
station reported values in every instance. See
<https://github.com/adamhsparks/GSODR/blob/devel/data-raw/fetch_isd-history.md>
for more detail on the correction methods.
